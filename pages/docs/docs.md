# Introduction
<div class="comment">Occurrent is in an early stage so API's, and even the data model, are subject to change in the future.</div>

Occurrent is an [event sourcing](#event-sourcing) library, or if you wish, a set of event sourcing utilities for the JVM, created by [Johan Haleby](https://code.haleby.se/).
There are many options for doing event sourcing in Java already so why build another one? There are a few reasons for this besides the
intrinsic joy of doing something yourself: 
 
* You should be able to design your domain model without _any_ dependencies to Occurrent or any other library. Your domain model can be expressed with pure functions that returns events. Use Occurrent to store these events.
  This is a very important design decision! Many people talk about doing this, but I find it rare in practise, and some existing event sourcing frameworks makes this difficult or non-idiomatic.
* Simple: Pick only the libraries you need, no need for an all or nothing solution. If you don't need subscriptions, then don't use them! Use the infrastructure 
  that you already have and hook these into Occurrent.
* Occurrent is not a database by itself. The goal is to be a thin wrapper around existing commodity databases that you may already be familiar with.  
* Events are stored in a standard format ([cloud events](https://cloudevents.io/)). You are responsible for serializing/deserializing the cloud events "body" (data) yourself.
  While this may seem like a limitation at first, why not just serialize your POJO directly to arbitrary JSON like you're used to?, it really enables a lot of use cases and piece of mind. For example:
  * It should be possible to hook in various standard components into Occurrent that understands cloud events. For example a component could visualize a distributed tracing graph from the cloud events
    if using the [distributed tracing cloud event extension](https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/master/extensions/distributed-tracing.md).
  * Since the current idea is to be as close as possible to the specification even in the database,  
    you can use the database to your advantage. For example, you can create custom indexes used for fast and fully consistent domain queries directly on an event stream (or even multiple streams).
* Composable: Function composition and pipes are encouraged. For example pipe the event stream to a rehydration function (any function that converts a stream of events to current state) before calling your domain model.
* Pragmatic: Need consistent projections? You can decide to write projections and events transactionally using tools you already know (such as Spring `@Transactional`)! 
* Interoperable/Portable: Cloud events is a [CNCF](https://www.cncf.io/) specification for describing event data in a common way. CloudEvents seeks to dramatically simplify event declaration and delivery across services, platforms, and beyond!
* Use the Occurrent components as lego bricks to compose your own pipelines. Components are designed to be small so that you should be able to re-write them tailored to your own needs if required. 
  Missing a component? You should be able to write one yourself and hook into the rest of the eco-system. Write your own problem/domain specific layer on-top of Occurrent.

# Concepts

## Event Sourcing

Every system needs to store and update data somehow. Many times this is done by storing the _current_ state of an entity in the database.
For example, you might have an entity called `Order` stored in a `order` table in a relational database. Everytime something happens
to the order, the table is updated with the new information and replacing the previous values. Event Sourcing is a technique that instead stores
the _changes_, represented by _events_, that occurred for the entity. Events are facts, things that have happened, and they should never be updated. 
This means that not only can you derive the current state from the set of historic events, but you also know _which_ steps that were involved to reach 
the current state. 

## EventStore

The event store is a place where you store events. Events are immutable pieces of data describing state changes for a particular _stream_. 
A stream is a collection of events that are related, typically but not limited to, a particular entity. For example a stream may include all events for a particular instance of a game or an order.

Occurrent provides an interface, `EventStore`, that allows to read and write events from the database. The `EventStore` interface actually is
composed of various smaller interfaces since not all databases supports all aspects provided by the `EventStore` interface. Here's an example 
that writes a cloud event to the event store and read it back: 

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/native/read-and-write-events.md %}

Note that when reading the events, the `EventStore` won't simply return a `Stream` of `CloudEvent`'s, instead it returns a wrapper called `EventStream`.

### EventStream            

The `EventStream` contains the `CloudEvent`'s for a stream and the version of the stream. The version can be used to guarantee that only one 
thread/process is allowed to write to the stream at the same time, i.e. optimistic locking. This can be achieved by including the version in a [write condition](#write-condition).

### Write Condition

A "write condition" can be used to specify conditional writes to the event store. Typically, the purpose of this would be to achieve [optimistic locking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optimistic_concurrency_control) of an event stream.

For example, image you have an `Account` to which you can deposit and withdraw money. A business rule says that it's not allowed to have a negative balance on an account.
Now imagine an account that is shared between two persons and contains 20 EUR. Person "A" wants to withdraw 15 EUR and person "B" wants to withdraw 10 EUR. 
If they try to do this, an error message should be presented to one of them since the account balance would be negative. But what happens if both persons try to withdraw
the money at the same time? Let's have a look:

{% capture java %}
// Person A at _time 1_
EventStream<CloudEvent> eventStream = eventStore.read("account1"); // A

// "withdraw" is a pure function in the Account domain model which takes a Stream
//  of all current events and the amount to withdraw, and returns new events. 
// In this case, a "MoneyWasWithdrawn" event is returned,  since 15 EUR is OK to withdraw.     
Stream<CloudEvent> events = Account.withdraw(eventStream.events(), Money.of(15, EUR));

// We write the new events to the event store  
eventStore.write("account1", events);

// Now in a different thread let's imagine Person B at _time 1_
EventStream<CloudEvent> eventStream = eventStore.read("account1"); // B

// Again we want to withdraw money, and the system will think this is OK, 
// since event streams for A and B has not yet recorded that the balance is negative.   
Stream<CloudEvent> events = Account.withdraw(eventStream.events(), Money.of(10, EUR));

// We write the new events to the event store without any problems! ðŸ˜± 
// But this shouldn't work since it would violate the business rule!   
eventStore.write("account1", events);
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
// Person A at _time 1_
val eventStream = eventStore.read("account1") // A

// "withdraw" is a pure function in the Account domain model which takes a Stream
//  of all current events and the amount to withdraw. It returns a stream of 
// new events, in this case only a "MoneyWasWithdrawn" event,  since 15 EUR is OK to withdraw.     
val events = Account.withdraw(eventStream.events(), Money.of(15, EUR))

// We write the new events to the event store  
eventStore.write("account1", events)

// Now in a different thread let's imagine Person B at _time 1_
val eventStream = eventStore.read("account1") // B

// Again we want to withdraw money, and the system will think this is OK, 
// since the Account thinks that 10 EUR will have a balance of 10 EUR after 
// the withdrawal.   
val events = Account.withdraw(eventStream.events(), Money.of(10, EUR))

// We write the new events to the event store without any problems! ðŸ˜± 
// But this shouldn't work since it would violate the business rule!   
eventStore.write("account1", events)
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippet.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}

<div class="comment">Note that typically the domain model, Account in this example, would not return CloudEvents but rather a stream or list of a custom data structure, domain events, that would then be <i>converted</i> to CloudEvent's. 
This is not shown in the example above for brevity.</div>

To avoid the problem above we want to make use of conditional writes. Let's see how:

{% capture java %}
// Person A at _time 1_
EventStream<CloudEvent> eventStream = eventStore.read("account1"); // A
long currentVersion = eventStream.version(); 

// Withdraw money
Stream<CloudEvent> events = Account.withdraw(eventStream.events(), Money.of(15, EUR));

// We write the new events to the event store with a write condition that implies
// that the version of the event stream must be A.   
eventStore.write("account1", currentVersion, events);

// Now in a different thread let's imagine Person B at _time 1_
EventStream<CloudEvent> eventStream = eventStore.read("account1"); // A 
long currentVersion = eventStream.version();

// Again we want to withdraw money, and the system will think this is OK, 
// since event streams for A and B has not yet recorded that the balance is negative.   
Stream<CloudEvent> events = Account.withdraw(eventStream.events(), Money.of(10, EUR));

// We write the new events to the event store with a write condition that implies
// that the version of the event stream must be B. But now Occurrent will throw
// a "org.occurrent.eventstore.api.WriteConditionNotFulfilledException" since, in this
// case A was slightly faster, and the version of the event stream no longer match!
// The entire operation should be retried for person B and when "Account.withdraw(..)"
// is called again it could throw a "CannotWithdrawSinceBalanceWouldBeNegative" exception. 
eventStore.write("account1", currentVersion, events); 
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
// Person A at _time 1_
val eventStream = eventStore.read("account1") // A
val currentVersion = eventStream.version() 

// Withdraw money
val events = Account.withdraw(eventStream.events(), Money.of(15, EUR));

// We write the new events to the event store with a write condition that implies
// that the version of the event stream must be A.   
eventStore.write("account1", currentVersion, events)

// Now in a different thread let's imagine Person B at _time 1_
val eventStream = eventStore.read("account1"); // A 
val currentVersion = eventStream.version()

// Again we want to withdraw money, and the system will think this is OK, 
// since event streams for A and B has not yet recorded that the balance is negative.   
val events = Account.withdraw(eventStream.events(), Money.of(10, EUR))

// We write the new events to the event store with a write condition that implies
// that the version of the event stream must be B. But now Occurrent will throw
// a "org.occurrent.eventstore.api.WriteConditionNotFulfilledException" since, in this
// case A was slightly faster, and the version of the event stream no longer match!
// The entire operation should be retried for person B and when "Account.withdraw(..)"
// is called again it could throw a "CannotWithdrawSinceBalanceWouldBeNegative" exception. 
eventStore.write("account1", currentVersion, events) 

{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippet.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}
       
What you've seen above is a simple, but widely used, form of write condition. Actually, doing `eventStore.write("streamId", version, events)` 
is just a shortcut for: 

{% capture java %}
eventStore.write("streamId", WriteCondition.streamVersionEq(version), events);
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
eventStore.write("streamId", WriteCondition.streamVersionEq(version), events)
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippet.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}
 
<div class="comment">WriteCondition can be imported from "org.occurrent.eventstore.api.WriteCondition".</div>

But you can compose a more advanced write condition using a `Condition`:

{% capture java %}
eventStore.write("streamId", WriteCondition.streamVersion(and(lt(10), ne(5)), events);
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
eventStore.write("streamId", WriteCondition.streamVersion(and(lt(10), ne(5)), events)
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippet.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}
 
where `lt`, `ne` and `and` is statically imported from `org.occurrent.condition.Condition`.           
       
Note that reading from a stream that doesn't exist will return `0` as version number.            

### EventStore Queries

Since Occurrent builds on-top of existing databases it's ok, given that you know what you're doing<span>&#42;</span>, to use the strengths of these databases.
One such strength is that typically databases have good querying support. Occurrent exposes this using the `EventStoreQueries` interface
that an `EventStore` implementation may implement to expose querying capabilities. For example:

{% capture java %}
ZonedDateTime lastTwoHours = ZonedDateTime.now().minusHours(2); 
// Query the database for all events the last two hours that have "subject" equal to "123" and sort these in descending order
Stream<CloudEvent> events = eventStore.query(time(lte(lastTwoHours)).and(subject("123")), SortBy.TIME_DESC);
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
val lastTwoHours = ZonedDateTime.now().minusHours(2);
// Query the database for all events the last two hours that have "subject" equal to "123" and sort these in descending order
val events : Stream<CloudEvent> = eventStore.query(time(lte(lastTwoHours)).and(subject("123")), SortBy.TIME_DESC)
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippet.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}

<div class="comment"><span>&#42;</span>There's a trade-off when it's appropriate to query the database vs creating materialized views/projections and you should most likely create indexes to allow for fast queries.</div>

The `time` and `subject`  methods are statically imported from `org.occurrent.filter.Filter` and `lte` is statically imported from `org.occurrent.condition.Condition`.  

`EventStoreQueries` is not bound to a particular stream, rather you can query _any_ stream (or multiple streams at the same time). 
It also provides the ability to get an "all" stream:
  
{% capture java %}
// Return all events in an event store sorted by descending order
Stream<CloudEvent> events = eventStore.all(SortBy.TIME_DESC);
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
// Return all events in an event store sorted by descending order
val events : Stream<CloudEvent> = eventStore.all(SortBy.TIME_DESC)
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippet.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}    

The `EventStoreQueries` interface also supports skip and limit capabilities which allows for pagination:

{% capture java %}
// Skip 42, limit 1024
Stream<CloudEvent> events = eventStore.all(42, 1024);
{% endcapture %}
{% capture kotlin %}
// Skip 42, limit 1024
val events : Stream<CloudEvent> = eventStore.all(42, 1024)
{% endcapture %}
{% include macros/docsSnippet.html java=java kotlin=kotlin %}    

To get started with an event store refer to [Choosing An EventStore](#choosing-an-eventstore).

## Subscriptions

A subscription is a way get notified when new events are written to an event store. Typically, a subscription will forward the event to another piece of infrastructure such as
a message bus, or to create views from the events (such as projections, sagas, snapshots etc). There are two different kinds of API's, the first one is a blocking 
API represented by the `BlockingSubscription` interface (in the `org.occurrent:subscription-api-blocking` module), and second one is a reactive API 
represented by the `ReactorSubscription` interface (in the `org.occurrent:subscription-api-reactor` module). 


The blocking API is callback based, which is fine if you're working with individual events (you can of course write a simple function that aggregates events into batches).
If you want to work with streams of data, the `ReactorSubscription` is probably a better option since it's using the [Flux](https://projectreactor.io/docs/core/release/api/reactor/core/publisher/Flux.html)
publisher from [project reactor](https://projectreactor.io/).

Note that it's fine to use `ReactorSubscription` for subscriptions, even though the event store is implemented using the blocking api, and vice versa.
If the datastore allows it, you can also run subscriptions in a different process from the datastore.   

To get started with subscriptions refer to [Using Subscriptions](#using-subscriptions).

## Views

## Command Bus?

## Sagas?

# Getting started

Getting started with Occurrent involves these steps:
<div class="comment">It's recommended to read up on <a href="https://cloudevents.io/">CloudEvent's</a> and its <a href="https://github.com/cloudevents/spec/blob/v1.0/spec.md">specification</a> so that you're familiar with the structure and schema of a CloudEvent.</div>

1. Choose an underlying datastore for an [event store](#choosing-an-eventstore). Luckily there are only two choices at the moment, MongoDB and an in-memory implementation. Hopefully this will be a more difficult decision in the future :)
1. Once a datastore has been decided it's time to [choose an EventStore implementation](#choosing-an-eventstore) for this datastore since there may be more than one.
1. If you need subscriptions (i.e. the ability to subscribe to changes from an EventStore) then you need to pick a library that implements this for the datastore that you've chosen. 
   Again, there may be several implementations to choose from.
1. If a subscriber needs to be able to continue from where it left off on application restart, it's worth looking into a so called "position storage" library. 
   These libraries provide means to automatically (or selectively) store the position for a subscriber to a datastore. Note that the datastore that stores this position
   can be a different datastore than the one used as EventStore. For example, you can use MongoDB as EventStore but store subscription positions in Redis. 

# Choosing An EventStore

There are currently two different datastores to choose from, [MongoDB](#mongodb) and [In-Memory](#in-memory). 

## MongoDB

Uses MongoDB, version 4.2 or above, as  the underlying datastore for the CloudEvents. All implementations use transactions to guarantee consistent writes (see WriteCondition).
Each EventStore will automatically create a few indexes (TODO describe these) on startup to allow for fast consistent writes, optimistic concurrency and to avoid duplicated events.
These indexes can also be used in queries against the EventStore (see EventStoreQueries). (TODO Also suggest wildcard indexes if `EventStoreQueries` is used)  
 
There are three different MongoDB EventStore implementations to choose from:
* [Native Driver](#eventstore-with-mongodb-native-driver)
* [Spring (Blocking)](#eventstore-with-spring-mongotemplate-blocking) 
* [Spring (Reactive)](#eventstore-with-spring-reactivemongotemplate-reactive) 

### EventStore with MongoDB Native Driver

#### What is it?
An EventStore implementation that uses the "native" Java MongoDB synchronous driver (see [website](https://docs.mongodb.com/drivers/java)) to read and write
[CloudEvent's](https://cloudevents.io/) to MongoDB.

#### When to use?
Use when you don't need Spring support and want to use MongoDB as the underlying datastore.

#### Dependencies

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/native/maven.md %}

#### Getting Started

Once you've imported the dependencies you create a new instance of `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.nativedriver.MongoEventStore`.
It takes four arguments, a [MongoClient](https://mongodb.github.io/mongo-java-driver/3.12/javadoc/com/mongodb/client/MongoClient.html), 
the "database" and "event collection "that the EventStore will use to store events as well as an `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.nativedriver.EventStoreConfig`.

For example:  

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/native/example-configuration.md %}


Now you can start reading and writing events to the EventStore:

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/native/read-and-write-events.md %}

#### Examples

| Name  | Description  | 
|:----|:-----|  
| [Number&nbsp;Guessing&nbsp;Game](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/tree/master/example/domain/number-guessing-game/mongodb/native) | A simple game implemented using a pure domain model and stores events in MongoDB using `MongoEventStore`. It also generates integration events and publishes these to RabbitMQ. |


### EventStore with Spring MongoTemplate (Blocking)  

#### What is it?
An implementation that uses Spring's [MongoTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/MongoTemplate.html)
to read and write events to/from MongoDB.     

#### When to use?
If you're already using Spring and you don't need reactive support then this is a good choice. You can make use of the `@Transactional` annotation to write events and views in the same tx (but make sure you understand what you're going before attempting this).

#### Dependencies

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/spring/blocking/maven.md %}

#### Getting Started

Once you've imported the dependencies you create a new instance of `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.spring.blocking.SpringBlockingMongoEventStore`.
It takes two arguments, a [MongoTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/MongoTemplate.html) and 
an `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.spring.blocking.EventStoreConfig`.

For example:  

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/spring/blocking/example-configuration.md %}

Now you can start reading and writing events to the EventStore:

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/spring/blocking/read-and-write-events.md %}

#### Examples

| Name  | Description  | 
|:----|:-----|  
| [Number&nbsp;Guessing&nbsp;Game](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/tree/master/example/domain/number-guessing-game/mongodb/spring/blocking) | A simple game implemented using a pure domain model and stores events in MongoDB using `SpringBlockingMongoEventStore` and Spring Boot. It also generates integration events and publishes these to RabbitMQ. |
| [Subscription&nbsp;View](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/tree/master/example/projection/spring-subscription-based-mongodb-projections/src/main/java/org/occurrent/example/eventstore/mongodb/spring/subscriptionprojections) | An example showing how to create a subscription that listens to certain events stored in the EventStore and updates a view/projection from these events. |
| [Transactional&nbsp;View](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/tree/master/example/projection/spring-transactional-projection-mongodb/src/main/java/org/occurrent/example/eventstore/mongodb/spring/transactional) | An example showing how to combine writing events to the `SpringBlockingMongoEventStore` and update a view transactionally using the `@Transactional` annotation. | 
| [Custom&nbsp;Aggregation&nbsp;View](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/tree/master/example/projection/spring-adhoc-evenstore-mongodb-queries/src/main/java/org/occurrent/example/eventstore/mongodb/spring/projections/adhoc) | Example demonstrating that you can query the `SpringBlockingMongoEventStore` using custom MongoDB aggregations. |

### EventStore with Spring ReactiveMongoTemplate (Reactive)
  
#### What is it?
An implementation that uses Spring's [ReactiveMongoTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/ReactiveMongoTemplate.html)
to read and write events to/from MongoDB.     

#### When to use?
If you're already using Spring and want to use the reactive driver ([project reactor](https://projectreactor.io/)) then this is a good choice. It uses the `ReactiveMongoTemplate` to write events to MongoDB. You can make use of the `@Transactional` annotation to write events and views in the same tx (but make sure that you understand what you're going before attempting this).

#### Dependencies

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/spring/reactor/maven.md %}

#### Getting Started

Once you've imported the dependencies you create a new instance of `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.spring.blocking.SpringBlockingMongoEventStore`.
It takes two arguments, a [MongoTemplate](https://docs.spring.io/spring-data/mongodb/docs/current/api/org/springframework/data/mongodb/core/MongoTemplate.html) and 
an `org.occurrent.eventstore.mongodb.spring.blocking.EventStoreConfig`.

For example:  

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/spring/reactor/example-configuration.md %}

Now you can start reading and writing events to the EventStore:

{% include macros/eventstore/mongodb/spring/reactor/read-and-write-events.md %}

#### Examples

| Name  | Description  | 
|:----|:-----|  
| [Custom&nbsp;Aggregation&nbsp;View](https://github.com/johanhaleby/occurrent/tree/master/example/projection/spring-adhoc-evenstore-mongodb-queries/src/main/java/org/occurrent/example/eventstore/mongodb/spring/projections/adhoc) | Example demonstrating that you can query the `SpringBlockingMongoEventStore` using custom MongoDB aggregations. |
